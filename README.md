# AngularJS-Minesweeper

## Scaffold
This repository is based on the scaffold (starter): https://github.com/dmellstrom/angularjs-gulp-starter.
So, please, regard the prerequisites and the "getting started" in this repository.

## Purpose
This application was (originally) ported from an Angular-2.0-application. 
This Angular-2-application was written by my colleague Philipp.
(Nevertheless, the entire structure had to be adapted for an AngularJS-application).
It led to an AngularJS-1.5-application which was intended as a training example, 
in order to use AngularJS-components.
In a next step, this application will be used as basis for another training example,
in order to port an (now) AngularJS-1.7-App to an Angular-8-App.
