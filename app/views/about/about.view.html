      This application was (originally) ported from an Angular-2.0-application. 
      This Angular-2-application was written by my colleague Philipp.
      (Nevertheless, the entire structure had to be adapted for an AngularJS-application).
      It led to an AngularJS-1.5-application which was intended as a training example, 
      in order to use AngularJS-components.
      In a next step, this application will be used as basis for another training example,
      in order to port an (now) AngularJS-1.7-App to an Angular-8-App.
